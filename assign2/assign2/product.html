		<h3>Road Bikes</h3>
			<p>Road bikes are generally used,you guessed it, on the road. They are specifically designed to provide the rider a nice fast-spaced yet smooth ride along the road. 
				Therefore, if you are planning on riding a long distance, you would generally go for the road bike, especially when riding on longer roads. Such bikes can also be used
				in sport, usually being used by cyclists.

	<div id="mountaininfo">
		<h3>Mountain Bikes</h3>
			<p>If you are planning on riding on rough terrain, generally mountains, then you would usually go for the mountain bike. These come with a better suspension to ensure
				the rider is still riding with ease and has complete control of the bike. Furthermore, the wheels are usually a lot more wider in order to deal with the rough terrain.

	<div id="cityinfo">
		<h3>City Bikes</h3>
			<p>City bikes are not exactly a type of bike, however it is a term used for bikes that are of course, ridden in the city. With an edgy look and urban design, these bikes are
				great for when you plan to ride in the city, while stilling looking good.

	<div id="hybridinfo">
		<h3>Hybrid Bikes</h3>
			<p>Hybrid bikes are a combination of both mountain and road bikes. Of course they achieve some of the advantages that both may offer, while simulateously lacking in some small areas.
				Therefore, if you plan on going on one particular trail, we suggest either mountain or road bikes. If you plan on going down both however, then we would definitely suggest the hybrid model.

	<div id="cruiserinfo">
		<h3>Cruiser Bikes</h3>
			<p>Cruiser Bikes are rather casual. They offer a very large seat for comfort, the pedals are placed a lot more forward in order to maintain a comfortable experience, and the handlebars are spread a lot more wider.
				Thus, if you wish to have a more relaxing riding experience along the coast and a slower pace, whilst still maintaining a comfortable attitude, then cruiser bikes are your go to.

	<div id="bmxinfo">
		<h3>BMX Bikes</h3>
			<p>BMX bikes are smaller and lighter bicycles, generally used to perform tricks both on the dirt and on the road (usually a skate park), however these bikes are generally not ridden anywhere else, as they can usually be 
				very uncomfortable. Thus, they should only be used if you plan on performing any stunts.
