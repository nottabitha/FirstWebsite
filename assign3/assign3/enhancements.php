		<h2> Image Map </h2>
			<p>The image map provides a small map within the product page that demonstrates a very brief view of the store (Swinburne University). It links both the university 
				and local train station (Glenferrie Station) into a small map that can be clicked on to bring up an external map of that specific area. Two areas exist that can
				be clicked on, Glenferrie and Swinburne.

		<h2> Gradient </h2>
			<p> The aside element on the product page was given a gradient background, shadows and border in order to make it stand out more, rather than providing a very bland textbox.
				This helps to keep the users attention whilst also providing a better look for the website, making it more professional.

		<h2> Hover and Transitions </h2>
			<p> I added hover and trasitions to the menu, whilst also adding unique links once they are hovered upon. When you hover on one of the menu links, it gradually changes to the color blue 
				stays like that for as long as you hover on it. For links, I made it so the underline does not show unless the link is being hovered upon in order to make it look better on the website.
